The genesis of ZERO was born from a fascination of hypotheses of dystopian futures, in turn leading to an enquiry on the challenges of existence and the question of what happens when at the precipice of death. Personally always having felt waves of anxiety towards notions of finality, the process has been a cathartic experience. Expect a complex constellation of movement qualities and textures on an energetic crash course. There are dramaturgical fragments however no narrative arc to uncover, it is an experience of feelings and atmospheres of mind. ZERO hopes to display this sense of impermanence as a beautifully fragile and ever-evolving kaleidoscopic state.
